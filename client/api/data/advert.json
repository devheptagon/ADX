The property is Grade II listed and all rooms are either en suite or have a designated shower room.<br>Our clients have carried out considerable improvements including a new boiler and the property has a very modern fire alarm system including a beacon system for the deaf; The property benefits from partial gas fired central heating which is currently laid to the Lower Ground, Ground and First Floors with independent electric heaters to rooms on the second and third floors making for efficiencies in the winter months.<br>A well established bed and breakfast business which has been in the present hands for many years and is now available due to ill health. Our clients, a husband and wife team purchased the business through Lawrence Wright and in recent years poor health has had an effect on the turnover and the agents have inspected accounts for the past five years which has seen turnover move from around £60,000 in 2015 to £48,000 in the most recent complete year but quality has not been compromised and the business remains in the <u>top ten on TripAdvisor with 100% rating the business Excellent or Very Good.</u></p><p>All business is attracted to the guest house <u>without the use of any booking agencies </u>with much repeat trade and excellent recommendations therefore profits are higher than average for this turnover. Of course, the employment of say Booking.com would boost turnover towards the vat threshold of £85,000 p.a.<br><br>Tenure: The property is held under the terms of a 60 year full repairing and insuring lease which commenced in September 2007 at a current rent of £14,500 p.a. which is fixed until the next rent review in September 2022</p><p>EPC: Not Applicable - Grade II Listed<br><br>Price: £320,000.<br><br>Call: Lawrence Wright, Sole Selling Agent on 01747 228941</p></div></div>",
